<p>Father’s Day is approaching soon. Are you prepared? Trying to pick out the perfect gift for dad can be a challenging task. You could spend hours on Pinterest looking for Father’s Day gift ideas in attempt of figuring out something that’s <em>just right</em>.</p>
<p>Rather than browsing shops in person or taking time to drive to the mall, why not shop online for a gift for your dad this year? In this article, we’ve sorted our top picks for dad into three categories, and have some info on why shopping online helps. We’ll tell you everything you need to know, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online stores with free and fast shipping</li>
<li>Websites to find the best deal</li>
<li>Places to find a unique gift</li>
<li>Why shop online for Father’s Day?</li>
</ul>
<p>Read on to find the perfect gift for dad with no hassle!</p>
<p id="free-or-fast-shipping"> </p>
<h2>Online stores with free and/or fast shipping</h2>
<h3>1. Amazon</h3>
<p><img alt="Amazon homepage" class="wp-image-12909" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/amazon-homepage-2.png"/></p>
<p>Amazon.com is an awesome e-commerce website. It has an enormous amount of products offerings, so no matter what your dad is into, you’ll probably be able to find something for him here. Amazon has lots of different departments, like home, electronics, clothing, and more. The site also has its own express shipping service, called Amazon Prime. If you need your gift in a rush, you can get it in 2 days or less if the item is Prime eligible.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>Amazon offers free two-day shipping on many of their items, so you can shop conveniently from home, without the added costs of shipping.</p>
<p><img alt="Amazon button" class="wp-image-12910" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/amazon-button.png"/></p>
<h3>2. Newegg</h3>
<p><img alt="Home page of the online electronics store Newegg" class="wp-image-12911" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/newegg-homepage.png"/></p>
<p>If dad loves all things tech, then Newegg.com is the best place for you. For years, it has been known to get some of the best deals online for tech-related items including laptops, TVs, computer accessories, hardware, software, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature:</strong> Newegg has 1, 2, or 3-day shipping on all items, and offers easy, free returns on any item.</p>
<p><img alt="Newegg button" class="wp-image-12912" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/newegg-button.png"/></p>
<h3>3. Best Buy</h3>
<p><img alt="BestBuy homepage" class="wp-image-12913" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bestbuy-homepage-8.png"/></p>
<p>Is your dad into electronics and tech-y stuff? If so, BestBuy.com is a great place to shop for a gift for him. Best Buy sells TVs, phones, home entertainment systems, appliances, and everything in between. Check out their Deal of the Day for awesome sales and discounts. Their standard shipping is 3 to 7 days, but they also offer one and two-day shipping options if you’re willing to pay extra. If you have a store location near you, you can also opt to order online and pick up in store – free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>The Best Buy <em>Geek Squad</em>. When you make a purchase, you can opt-in for continued technical support for your purchased items, and have them fixed in the future if anything goes wrong.</p>
<p><img alt="BestBuy button" class="wp-image-12914" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bestbuy-button.png"/></p>
<p id="best-deals"> </p>
<h2>Websites to find the best deal</h2>
<h3><strong>4</strong>. eBay</h3>
<p><img alt="eBay homepage" class="wp-image-12915" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ebay-homepage-4.png"/></p>
<p>Another great place for gift shopping online is eBay.com. This site is awesome if you’re looking to save some money on your purchase. eBay is both an online store and an auction website, so you may be able to find some real bargains! Similarly to Amazon, eBay has several categories of items, so there’s a lot to choose from. You may also be able to find things that have been discontinued or are out of stock in stores in your area.</p>
<p>Processing and shipping times can vary when shopping on eBay because of the nature of the site. Anyone can register as an eBay seller, so different sellers will have different timelines for processing and shipping. Shipping times will also depend on how far your package has to travel to get to you. If you want to learn more about the site, check out our free eBay course.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>eBay’s auction-style sales allow you to bid on items, meaning you can sometimes get what you want for much lower than retail prices.</p>
<p><img alt="eBay button" class="wp-image-12916" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ebay-button.png"/></p>
<h3>5. Wal-Mart</h3>
<p><img alt="Walmart homepage" class="wp-image-12917" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/walmart-homepage-12.png"/></p>
<p>Chances are that you’ve heard of this big box store. WalMart.com sells everything from groceries to car parts, so you can definitely find great gifts here too! If you don’t live near a Walmart location, you can shop their store online instead! They currently have a great “Step Up His Style” section on their site with some great gift options for dad as well. Walmart has free 2-day shipping on orders over $35. If you live near one of their store locations, you can even get discounts on certain items when you order online and opt to pick up your order at a store.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>Free 2-day shipping on orders over $35 – in case you left your shopping a little late this year.</p>
<p><img alt="Walmart button" class="wp-image-12918" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/walmart-button.png"/></p>
<h3>6. Target</h3>
<p><img alt="Target homepage" class="wp-image-12919" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/target-homepage.png"/></p>
<p>Like Walmart, Target.com. sells a huge variety of products. The difference between Walmart and Target is that while Walmart focuses on bringing their customers the lowest prices they can, Target focuses more on stocking new, trendy items in many of their departments. This is a great place to find Father’s Day gifts for all of the men in your life this Father’s Day.</p>
<p>Just like Walmart, Target offers free shipping on all orders totalling over $35, and also allows customers to order online and pick up in-store for free. In certain US cities, you can use Target’s “Instacart” program and have your order delivered within 2 hours of placement!</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>Free shipping on orders over $35, and (in some cases) 2-hour delivery!</p>
<p><img alt="Target button" class="wp-image-12920" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/target-button.png"/></p>
<p id="unique-gifts"> </p>
<h2>Places to find a unique gift</h2>
<h3>7. Etsy</h3>
<p><img alt="Etsy homepage" class="wp-image-12921" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etsy-homepage-6.png"/></p>
<p>If your dad likes things that are unique or personalized, Etsy.com is a great place to look. Etsy is like an online marketplace where artisans, craftsmen and other talented people can sell their creations. You can find things like jewellery, artwork, furniture, and more. Keep in mind that if you’re ordering a custom or personalized item, it could take a while for your order to be completed. Get your orders in as soon as you can to ensure your order will arrive before Father’s Day.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>Etsy has a unique catalogue of items, so you can give dad something special, rather than typical mass-produced items.</p>
<p><img alt="Etsy button" class="wp-image-12922" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/etsy-button.png"/></p>
<h3>8. StubHub</h3>
<p><img alt="StubHub homepage" class="wp-image-12923" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stubhub-homepage-10.png"/></p>
<p>Looking to purchase tickets for a sports game, concert, or other event? You can find tickets to all kinds of events on StubHub.com. This site allows people to re-sell tickets they’ve purchased elsewhere (if they have extras, can no longer attend, etc.). As a result, you can often find tickets at a discounted price, or tickets to shows that are sold out everywhere else. If you want to give your dad the gift of an awesome experience, you should give StubHub a try.</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature: </strong>StubHub has a “Fan Protect Guarantee” that ensures you will receive your tickets on time, and they will be valid, or your money back.</p>
<p><img alt="StubHub button" class="wp-image-12924" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/stubhub-button.png"/></p>
<h3>9. Touch of Modern</h3>
<p><img alt="Home page of the Touch Of Modern app" class="wp-image-12925" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/touch-of-modern-app.png"/></p>
<p>TouchOfModern.com is meant for men, and full of modern designs up to 70% off retail pricing – if dad is into clothing. You can find clothes, watches, and other accessories he’ll love, and you can even find tech accessories, gadgets, home décor, gadgets, and so much more. Daily items and new deals are added to the app daily (<strong>Download:</strong> Android | iOS), so you won’t miss out on your chance to find something sleek for dad – and save some money doing it!</p>
<p><strong>Best Feature</strong>: Deals offered daily up to 70% off of designer items you find.</p>
<p><img alt="Button to go to Touch Of Modern" class="wp-image-12926" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/touchofmodern-button.png"/></p>
<p id="why-shop-online"> </p>

<p><em>This post is sponsored by Michelob ULTRA but the content and opinions expressed here are my own. It is intended for those 21+</em><br /> <strong>Father’s Day is right around the corner! Now you can customize your Father’s favorite coozie or t-shirt with these FREE SVG files! Pick between the beer SVG, the Dad Bod SVG or use both! See how I easily added “BEER” to a wooden drink caddy and made a witty Dad Bod t-shirt for my husband!</strong></p>
<p><noscript><img alt="Dad Bod SVG File on a t-shirt" class="wp-image-12854" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dad-Bod-SVG-file-on-a-t-shirt-SM-1.jpg"/></noscript></p>
<p>Summer is in full swing here and we are loving it! Well, everyone except for Hubs. Sadly, the Major has to go to work everyday and can’t sleep in, stay up late, or have a lazy afternoon like the rest of us. He’s such a good Dad though, and even though it’s summer, he has found several ways to really optimize our family time together.</p>
<p><span id="more-7540"></span></p>
<p><noscript><img alt="Father's Day Grilling" class="wp-image-12855" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fathers-Day-Grilling-1.jpg"/></noscript></p>
<p>He goes to work all day, but he’s still mindful to the fact that I have been spending 24/7 with 4 boys. There are days that I am just exhausted. They wear me out I tell ya!!!! On days like this, when he knows I’m at my wits end, he happily takes over and makes dinner. Most summer nights that means manning the grill. Since he’s the BBQ Master, I’m totally getting him the awesome apron found HERE for Father’s Day! </p>
<p><noscript><img alt="Father's Day SVG for t-shirts" class="wp-image-12856" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Fathers-Day-SVG-for-t-shirts-1.jpg"/></noscript></p>
<p>We are not as young as we used to be, and it’s workouts seem to be not quite as easy as they used to be, but Hubs still powers through. Gone are the days of fervently training to max an Army PT test, now replaced by just trying to keep up with the boys! He’s always been faithful to his workouts, but now he does them at lunchtime so he doesn’t take any time away from family. Since he loves a cool one in the evening, I came up with this witty t-shirt that says, “Dad Bod working on my six pack”. It seemed to fit him perfectly!</p>
<p><noscript><img alt="wooden beer holder customized with the word BEER via free SVG." class="wp-image-12857" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Wooden-Beer-holder-with-BEER-Svg-1.jpg"/></noscript></p>
<p>While I had my Cricut machine out and was designing the t-shirt, I decided to also create a beer SVG file. I love the way this came out. I attached it to a wooden beer crate that we already have, and now it looks super snazzy. I might go back and add his name to personalize it even more.</p>
<p><noscript><img alt="Michelob Ultra in a customized beer caddy" class="wp-image-12858" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Michelob-Ultra-in-a-customized-beer-caddy-1.jpg"/></noscript></p>
<p>Michelob ULTRA has become a new favorite around here. Lately, we’ve been all about “balance”. Balancing screen time with outdoor time, balancing fruits &amp; veggies with sweet treats, and balancing how many hours of sleep those growing teenagers really need. Michelob ULTRA is all about balance too! Each bottle contains only 95 calories and 2.6 grams of carbs! This makes it so much easier to fit a beer in after a long day of workouts and healthy eating, without blowing the diet!</p>
<p>I personally think my guy is the #ULTRADAD but there are so many other’s out there! Michelob ULTRA is celebrating all those #ULTRADAD‘s out there too! They have some awesome gear for your favorite dad, so be sure to check out the #ULTRADAD shop! </p>
<p>Thanks so much for stopping by today! You can find the beer SVG file and the Dad Bod SVG file directly below. If you do create something, please tag me on social media so I can see!</p>
<h3>Using a Cricut? Here are some tips for using the BEER SVG file and others:</h3>
<ul>
<li>upload as an SVG directly into Cricut Design Space</li>
<li>Resize to the size you’d like</li>
<li>Weld the letters together. Cricut likes to keep those letters separate, but this gets around that!</li>
<li>Copy the design if you’d like more</li>
<li>Remember if you are doing a t-shirt with iron on vinyl- make sure you select the “mirror” option</li>
<li>I use my lightpad to weed and I love it, but in a pinch, you can easily place the vinyl against a window to see the lines better!</li>
</ul>

Over 10 sayings to choose from and we even have a Grandpa SVG, a Papa SVG and a Pop SVG for that special grandfather in your life.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Free SVGs for Dad and Grandpa</h2>
<p class="has-large-font-size">In our family my husband’s birthday is right near Father’s Day. Some years his birthday and Father’s Day land on the same day. I always make sure we do something for both because both days are equally as important to us.</p>
<p class="has-large-font-size">But what do you get the man who has everything? When asked my husband usually replies with “nothing”. Sound familiar? Well, if he doesn’t give me any ideas then he will leave me with no choice. Que the handmade gifts.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size">Don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. As a matter of fact, any chance I get to take out my Silhouette Cameo and make something handmade is a chance I’m going to take.</p>
<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Handmade Father’s Day Gifts for Dad</h3>
<p class="has-large-font-size">When you start thinking about Handmade Father’s Day Gifts for Dad, what do you think of? Mugs, T-shirts, Tumblers, Necktie Cards….the usual, right? I mean, what dad doesn’t love to wear a cool tee? If I’m being honest, my husband probably has more t-shirts in his wardrobe than any other item.</p>
<p class="has-large-font-size">Before we get started on the “how-to” of it all, let’s take a look at the FREE SVGs for Dad.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><noscript><img alt="Photo collage of SVG cut files for dad" class="wp-image-12843" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dad-SVG-Hero1-1-492x1024-1.png"/></noscript></div>
<p class="has-large-font-size">I took to Facebook a few weeks ago and asked for some Father’s Day SVG suggestions. I had a few of my own jotted down beforehand and then the rest came from my friends and family. There’s something for everyone.</p>
<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Teenage daughter survivor svg</h3>
<p class="has-large-font-size">Having 2 teenage daughters of my own, my favorite <em>SVG for Dad</em> is this funny Teenage Daughter Survivor SVG. My girls are 16 and (almost) 14 and man, are we in the thick of it. This is definitely at the top of our list.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size">*Note: No matter how many projects I do, I always read the package instructions before ironing my SVG to the materials I’m using.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Favorite Fonts for Creating SVG Cut Files</h2>
<p class="has-large-font-size">I love a good handwritten script font. I gravitate towards them when I’m on the hunt for new fonts. For this Father’s Day SVG Bundle I knew I had to take a more masculine route so I hunted for something a little less frilly. Here are the fonts that I used in these designs. If you see something you like, head on over and snag them.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Free Father’s Day Best Dad Ever Cut Files</h2>
<p>Father’s Day snuck up on me this year (whoops!) – so I’m making last minute gifts with new SVG cut files, too. My husband is a great supporter of our kids’ sports activities, so I wanted to mix up the files this year. I created a whole Father’s Day set of Best Dad Ever cut files that you can use to make all sorts of gifts – I’m thinking a Father’s Day mug or Yeti tumbler is going to make a great gift this year!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Supplies Needed to Make Father’s Day Gifts with your Cricut or Silhouette Machine</h3>
<p>If you’d like to make Father’s Day gifts, you’ll need some Cricut &amp; Silhouette supplies! Here’s some of the basic craft supplies I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting Machine (Buy a Cricut on Amazon or on the Cricut Online Shop | Silhouette on Amazon)</li>
<li>Iron On Vinyl</li>
<li>Cricut EasyPress 2 or Regular Iron</li>
<li>Permanent Vinyl (for mugs, tumblers, etc.)</li>
<li>Transfer Paper</li>
<li>Father’s Day SVG (Download at the end of the post)</li>
<li>Blank Shirt (here’s the unisex Blue Heather Raglan I used on Amazon)</li>
<li>Here are some great options for tumblers, mugs, and even a cooler (that have Prime shipping on Amazon, so they’re perfect for last minute Father’s Day gifts).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to make a Best Dad Ever shirt with your Cricut, here’s a short tutorial – it’s so easy!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">How to Make a Father’s Day Shirt with a SVG Cut File and your Cricut Machine</h2>
<p>Upload your Best Dad Ever SVG file to your cutting software and size it to fit your shirt or onesie. Make sure to MIRROR the design before cutting, and then cut when ready. The shiny side of the vinyl goes DOWN on your mat. Weed away the extra vinyl. Iron on or use the EasyPress 2 to press the vinyl design onto the shirt. If you’re using the Cricut EasyPress, for recommendations based on your materials, you can check out the Cricut EasyPress Recommended Settings.</p>

<p>To make a Father’s Day tumbler, the tutorial is just as easy!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">How to Make a Father’s Day Tumbler with a SVG File and Vinyl</h2>
<p>Upload your Best Dad Ever SVG file to your cutting software and size it to fit your mug or tumbler. The colored side of the vinyl goes UP on your mat. Cut when ready. Weed away the extra vinyl. Using transfer tape, apply vinyl design to the mug or tumbler, starting with the middle of the design and working your way out.</p>

<p>*Pro tip: If you’re making your own design in Cricut Design Space, curve your design slightly so when you apply it to a curved surface, it comes out straight. Here’s a great tutorial for Curving Text in Design Space from Heidi at Happiness is Homemade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">If you have a fun-loving dad in your life, these 13 free Funny Father’s Day SVG files from my friends and I are a must-have. I contributed the “World’s Best Farter…Father” file, because I mean…both are true, right? </p>

<p>I made this file to be a bit customizable! There are 2 cross-outs so you can make it a slash or an X and there are two layers so you can make it one color or add that background layer to give it a bit more dimension. </p>
<p>If you missed them, we also did a set of Hot Mess Mom Free Files. I think it’s fun to celebrate the less glamorous parts of parenthood! </p>
